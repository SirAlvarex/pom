# POM

A Golang library used to interact with POMs, a common configuration file for building Java code.

# Get the code
`go get github.com/SirAlvarex/pom`

# ...why?

At Yammer we have a lot of Java microservices, and managing the POM of each of those microservices is a huge pain.

This library was created to help ease that pain.
